The MIT Mobile Web is a modular framework for creating and hosting web services optimized for mobile devices. 

It includes specialized modules for searching and browsing LDAP and ArchGIS, as well as more MIT specific services like Stellar and the Events Calendar. It also includes generic modules like 3Down and Emergency Info, which could be modified to present any RSS feed in a mobile-friendly manner.

MIT Mobile Web is written with PHP, Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It uses Python with the open source Wireless Universal Resource File (WURFL) to categorize devices, allowing for an experience tailored to each device's capabilities. It uses PHP to dynamically generate pages and also handles the parsing and quering of external services, such as LDAP and ArchGIS. Javascript is used for more modern devices to provide a more dynamic experience, such as the special behavior of the Shuttle Schedule when an iPhone's orientation changes. 

There is currently a lot of duplicated effort among schools looking to implement their own mobile web, and most schools don't even have the resources to start from scratch. Many educational institutions have similar infrastructure to MIT, so adapting the MIT Mobile Web to work with their services would be relatively simple. Opening up the source to the MIT Mobile Web will garner goodwill and prestige among educational institutions.
