		<h2>Parking Suggestions</h2>
		<p>Parking in Cambridge and Boston is generally not an enjoyable experience. Whenever possible, park your car at the hotel at which you are staying, and use <a href="directions-t.html">public transportation</a> to get to the MIT campus. If you must drive to the campus, there is both on- and off-street parking available, but most public parking is not very close to the center of the MIT campus (unless you arrive early in the morning or late in the evening).</p>
		<p>There is metered parking on Massachusetts Avenue for short stays and evenings/weekends, as well as a number of lots at which you may park for a fee. These include <a href="detail.html?q=P16">Vassar St. Public Parking</a> at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Vassar Street, <a href="detail.html?q=P37">University Park / Star Market Public Parking</a>, and the <a href="detail.html?q=P10">Marriott Parking Garage</a> on Ames St. and Broadway.</p>
		<p>If you were invited to campus and a visitor parking hang tag was given to you, you may park in the lots specified on the hang tag. Please check the <a href="parking.html">parking lot</a> listing and plan your trip accordingly.</p>
